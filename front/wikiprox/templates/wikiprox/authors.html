<h1>Authors</h1>

<p>The contributors to the Densho Encyclopedia represent a diverse range
of backgrounds and experiences. Many are professional scholars who
have authored important books or articles that specifically cover the
topics they write about here. Others are graduate students whose
research focuses on some aspect of the Japanese American experience.
Still others are journalists, community activists, or individuals who have
played a role in telling the Japanese American story or who have been
active players in that story. The roster below contains links to their
bios and a list of entries they have contributed to the encyclopedia.</p>
