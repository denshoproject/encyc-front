			<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>	The Densho Encyclopedia is a free and publicly accessible website that provides concise, accurate, and balanced information on many aspects of the Japanese American story during World War II. It is designed and written for a non-specialist audience that includes high school and college students and instructors, multiple generations of Nikkei community members, confinement sites preservation groups, amateur and professional historians, librarians, journalists, documentarians, and the general public.</p>

	<div class="row-fluid">
		<div class="span8">
			<p>The Encyclopedia is thoroughly cross indexed and articles are linked to relevant primary and secondary materials from the Densho archive and from other websites that include still and moving images, documents, databases, and oral history interview excerpts as well as standard bibliographical sources.</p>

			<p>The editor of the Encyclopedia is Brian Niiya, Director of Content at Densho. Niiya has previously served as the editor of the <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/247539278" target="_blank"><em>Encyclopedia of Japanese American History: An A-to-Z Reference</em></a>, published in 2000. The blue ribbon advisory committee consists of Eiichiro Azuma, the Alan Charles Kors Term Associate Professor of History and Asian American Studies at the University of Pennsylvania; Roger Daniels, Charles Phelps Taft Professor of History Emeritus in the University of Cincinnati; Lane Hirabayashi, George and Sakaye Aratani Professor in Japanese American Redress, Internment and Community and chair of the Asian American Studies Department at UCLA; Franklin Odo, former director of the Asian Pacific American Program at the Smithsonian Institution; Greg Robinson, Professor of History at l'Université du Québec À Montréal; and Tetsuden Kashima, professor, American Ethnic Studies, University of Washington.</p>

			<p>The first phase of the project, containing more than 300 articles was launched online September 1, 2012. The Encyclopedia is envisioned as a long-term, living resource that will continue to grow over time. Additional articles and features will be added, and the project governance structure is being designed to emphasize sustainability.</p>
